Everyone, today we're covering the concept of supply and demand in modern economics. First, note that supply represents how much the market can offer, while demand represents how much of a product or service is desired by buyers. Don't forget, next week you'll have a quiz on Tuesday covering the basics of elasticity. Please make sure to review chapters 3 and 4.

If you'd like, you can set a reminder to review your notes every two days until the test. Now, let's move on to an example. Imagine the price of coffee increases by 10%. Consumers may decide to switch to tea instead. This is an example of cross-price elasticity. Write down that term in your notebooks, because it often shows up on exams. For example, if you've been to GFBI, you've been to this place, but you've been to L.A. Those who've been to GFBI, you've been to M.G. N.G. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F. F.
