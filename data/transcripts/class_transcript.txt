Good morning, everyone. Today we're covering the concept of supply and demand in modern economics. First, note that supply represents how much the market can offer, while demand represents how much of a product or service is desired by buyers. Don't forget, next week you'll have a quiz on Tuesday covering the basics of elasticity. Please make sure to review chapters 3 and 4. Also, I want to remind you that your midterm exam is scheduled for the 15th of October. That means you should start preparing earlier. If you'd like, you can set a reminder to review your notes every two days until the test. Now, let's move on to an example. Imagine the price of coffee increases by 10%. Consumers may decide to switch to tea instead. This is an example of cross-price elasticity. Write down that term in your notebooks, because it often shows up on exams. Another important thing, we will have a guest lecture on Monday, October 7th. Please save this in your calendar. Attendance will be mandatory. Before I wrap up, let me summarize. Exam on October 15th. Quiz next Tuesday. Guest lecture on October 7th. Review elasticity concepts and cross-price elasticity. Finally, as a personal suggestion, if you struggle with graphs, try practicing at least 15 minutes a day. Maybe even remind yourself with a small alert on your phone to keep track. It makes a difference over time. That's all for today. Any questions before we finish?
